## Creating Patch Files

Create patch file with:  

```shell
git diff some-file > patch-name.patch
```

Test with:  

```shell
git apply patch-name.patch
```

Multiple diffs/patches can be in the same patch file.

Be sure to use `-p1` flag e.g. `%patch0 -p1` if generating patch with `git diff`. Explained in the references below.
